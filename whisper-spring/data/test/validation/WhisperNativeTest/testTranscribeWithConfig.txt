Whisper spring is a Java library that integrates the Whisper.CPPE speech-text engine in
 to spring-based applications.
 It packages prebuilt Linux binaries and Java binings from the Whisper.CPPE project, making
 an easy to use, open AI-dust Whisper model for audio transcription.
 The project is structured into three modules, a core library, a command line interface, and
 a server component, supporting a range of deployment scenarios.
