[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   Whisper Spring is a Java library that integrates the Whisper.CPP speech-text engine into
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.240]   spring-based applications.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.000]   It packages pre-built Linux binaries and Java bindings from the Whisper.CPP project, making
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.840]   an easy-to-use, open AI-dust Whisper model for audio transcription.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.360]   The project is structured into three modules, a core library, a command line interface,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.640]   and a server component, supporting a range of deployment scenarios.
[ Progress: 100% ]
